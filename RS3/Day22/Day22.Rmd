# Normal probability plot shows that normality is reasonable.
# Because the residuals vs. fitted plot displays a fairly even band, equal variance is reasonable.

# d)
# Because the p-value for acid is significant, there is evidence that growth differs by acid treatment.

# e)
# Because the p-value for row is not significant, differences across rows are probably due to randomness.
