"0","#a) To compare how metabolic rate depends on body size across free and non-free growth periods, use this model: MR = b0 + b1(BodySize) + b2(Ifgp) + b3(BodySize × Ifgp) + error. Here, Ifgp is a dummy variable indicating whether the observation comes from the free growth period."
"0","#b) If the effect of body size on metabolic rate (slope) remains the same across growth periods, but the baseline (intercept) differs, the model becomes: MR = b0 + b1(BodySize) + b2(Ifgp) + error. This means both groups share the same rate of change, but start at different average metabolic rates."
"0","#c) To determine whether one or two regression lines are needed, compare two models: Full model: MR = b0 + b1(BodySize) + b2(Ifgp) + b3(BodySize × Ifgp) + error. Reduced model: MR = b0 + b1(BodySize) + error. If the interaction and group variables don’t significantly improve the fit, one regression line suffices."

"0","#a) Degrees of freedom are calculated as the total sample size minus the number of predictors minus one. With three predictors, that’s 53 - 3 - 1 = 49."
"0","#b) If there are two predictors, then 53 - 2 - 1 = 50 degrees of freedom. In general, adding more predictors reduces the remaining degrees of freedom for the error term."
