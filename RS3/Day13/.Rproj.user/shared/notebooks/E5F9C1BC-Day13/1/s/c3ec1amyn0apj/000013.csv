"0","# c. The simulated mean is 1.093031 with a standard deviation of 0.1205294, which is fairly similar to the original model’s standard deviation of 0.09699. These results are based on a sample of 5000 observations."
"0","# d. Using the standard error calculation, the interval 1.077 +- 1.645 × 0.1205294 gives a confidence range of (0.8787, 1.2752)."

"0","# Method 1: Using the formula 1.818 +- 1.645 × 0.1734197, I got a 90% confidence interval of (1.5327, 2.1033). This suggests that the true standard error is likely within that range."
"0","# Method 2: The second approach produced a slightly different interval of (1.478401, 2.043009)."
"0","# Method 3: For the percentile-based method, I compared how far each bound was from the mean:"
"0","# Upper distance --> 2.043009−1.818=0.225"
"0","# Lower distance --> 1.818−1.478401=0.340"
"0","# Reflecting those values symmetrically around the mean gives an approximate interval of (1.478, 2.043). So based on this method, the actual slope is expected to fall within that range."

"0","# Parts (a) and (b) were completed within the R code, so I focused on summarizing the remaining methods."
"0","# Method 1: Using the standard error technique, I rounded the standard deviation to 0.181 and the mean correlation to 0.2662. With a 95% confidence level (z∗ = 1.96) the interval 0.2662±1.96×0.181 gives (-0.08856, 0.62096). This suggests that the true correlation between GPA and Verbal SAT likely lies somewhere within that range."
"0","# Method 2: The percentile method produced a similar interval: (-0.09149876, 0.61056238)."
"0","# Method 3: Using the reflected percentile approach with r = 0.3154 , I calculated how far each bound was from the mean:"
"0","# Upper distance: 0.61056238−0.3154=0.29516238"
"0","# Lower distance: 0.3154−(−0.09149876)=0.40689876"
"0","# Reversing these distances around the mean gave an estimated interval of (0.02023762, 0.72229876)."
"0","# Summary: All three methods yield ranges that cluster around approximately -0.10 to 0.60 (or slightly above). The third method shifts the interval a bit more toward positive values. However, since zero is included in every interval, there is not strong evidence of a definite relationship between GPA and Verbal SAT scores. The true correlation could be positive, negative, or even nonexistent."
