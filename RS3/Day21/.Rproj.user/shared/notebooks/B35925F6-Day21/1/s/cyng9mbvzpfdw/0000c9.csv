"0","# The plot shows a clear pattern across pot types. Foods cooked in iron pots consistently contain the highest iron levels, regardless of the dish. In comparison, foods cooked in clay pots have the lowest iron content, and aluminum pots fall in between, slightly higher than clay but still noticeably below iron pots."
"0","# "
"0","# There are two noticeably low points for the clay-cooked meat and vegetable dishes, which may weaken the apparent difference between clay and aluminum pots. This unequal spread across groups suggests that changing the scale (for example, using a transformation) would not  fix the variability issue, since the smallest variability occurs near the center of the scale rather than at the extremes."
"0","# "
"0","# Overall, the pot type appears to meaningfully influence iron content, but the presence of outliers and unequal spreads should be considered when interpreting differences between clay and aluminum groups."
