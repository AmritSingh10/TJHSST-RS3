"0","#a. A high r^2 can occur when the data have a strong relationship but follow a curved trend instead of a straight line. In such cases, a linear model explains much of the variability but doesn’t fully capture the pattern. Transforming the variables to straighten the curve could produce a more accurate fit."
"0",""
"0","# b. A low r^2 doesn’t necessarily imply the linear model is unsuitable. If the true relationship is a straight line but the data points scatter widely due to random error, the r^2 will appear low. This reflects noise in the data, not a flaw in using a linear model."
