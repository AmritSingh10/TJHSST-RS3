# 2.9:
#a. A high r^2 can occur when the data have a strong relationship but follow a curved trend instead of a straight line. In such cases, a linear model explains much of the variability but doesn’t fully capture the pattern. Transforming the variables to straighten the curve could produce a more accurate fit.

# b. A low r^2 doesn’t necessarily imply the linear model is unsuitable. If the true relationship is a straight line but the data points scatter widely due to random error, the r^2 will appear low. This reflects noise in the data, not a flaw in using a linear model.

# 2.10:
# a. Adding more data points narrows prediction intervals since the 1/n term decreases and higher degrees of freedom slightly reduce the critical t-value.

# b. Greater spread in predictor values reduces standard error near the data’s center, tightening prediction intervals in that region.

# c. Higher overall variability in the response increases the residual standard deviation, raising prediction error and widening intervals.

# d. Predictions made farther from the mean of the predictor carry higher leverage, inflating error and widening intervals at those points.

# 2.23:
USstamps <- read_csv("USStamps.csv")

stamps <- USstamps[!(USstamps$Year %in% c(1885, 1917, 1919, 1932)), ]
stamp_mod <- lm(Price ~ Year, data = stamps)
summary(stamp_mod)

# a. With R^2 ≈98.5%, nearly all variation in stamp prices is explained by year, showing that time is an excellent predictor of the trend.

# b. The slope’s very high t-value and near-zero p-value provide strong evidence of a robust linear link between postage costs and year.

# c. The ANOVA results, featuring a massive F-statistic and negligible p-value, confirm that the regression on year explains almost all stamp price variation, with little unexplained error.

# 2.27

BreesPass <- read_csv("BreesPass.csv")
brees_mod <- lm(Yards ~ Attempts, data = BreesPass)
summary(brees_mod)
plot(BreesPass$Attempts, BreesPass$Yards, pch=19, col="blue")
abline(brees_mod, col="red", lwd=2)


# a. The regression line is Yards = 86.1 + 5.69 × Attempts, showing a moderately positive trend where more pass attempts generally correspond to more yards.

# b. The season average of about 7.7 yards per attempt exceeds the slope of 5.69, since the regression slope reflects the game-level relationship rather than the overall per-pass ratio.

# c. An R^2 of roughly 0.34 indicates that about 34% of the variation in Brees’s passing yards can be attributed to attempts, with most variation explained by other influences.

# 2.31
Pines <- read_csv("Pines.csv")
pine_mod <- lm(Hgt97 ~ Hgt90, data = Pines)
summary(pine_mod)
anova(pine_mod)

# a. The regression slope is highly significant with an extremely small p-value, indicating a clear link between 1990 starting height and 1997 tree height.

# b. With an R^2 of only about 2.7%, the 1990 height explains very little of the later variation, so the model has weak predictive value.

# c. The ANOVA results split the total variation into regression SS (≈138,344) and residual SS (≈5,010,010), underscoring the model’s limited explanatory power.

# d. Calculating regression SS over total SS yields about 0.027, consistent with the reported R^2, confirming agreement between the ANOVA and summary output.

# e. Although statistically significant, the model explains so little variation that it’s not practically useful for predicting 1997 heights.

# 2.33
pine_mod2 <- lm(Hgt97 ~ Hgt96, data = Pines)
summary(pine_mod2)
confint(pine_mod2, level = 0.95)

# a. The 95% confidence interval for the slope, about (1.079, 1.113), shows strong evidence that each extra unit of 1996 height corresponds to slightly more than one unit of 1997 height.

# b. Because the entire interval lies above 1, we can infer that the trees experienced growth from 1996 to 1997, with the rate exceeding a one-to-one increase.

# c. The intercept is not meaningful here, since predicting 1997 height at zero 1996 height has no biological relevance.
