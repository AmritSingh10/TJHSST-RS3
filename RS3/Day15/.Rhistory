# b. Yes. This can occur if one residual is negative enough to offset several positive ones, keeping the total at zero.
# c. Yes. A residual reflects distance from the group mean, not relative ranking. So one person may have a higher raw score but a smaller residual if it’s closer to the mean.
# d. Yes. Residuals are calculated within each group’s mean. Even if one group’s average is higher, a member can still have a smaller residual relative to that mean.
