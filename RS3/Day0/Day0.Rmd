# Problem 5: Vector indexing practice

x + 1

y * 2
# 3. Length of x and y
length(x)

# 4. Add corresponding elements of x and y
x + y
# 5. Count how many elements of x are > 5
sum(x > 5)
# Sum of values in x that are > 5
sum(x[x > 5])
# 6. Elements of x greater than 5 OR less than 3
sum(x > 5 | x < 3)
# 7. Third element of y
y[3]
# 8. All elements of y except the third
y[-3]
# 9. Use x as indices into y
y[x]
# 10. Elements of y that are >= 7
y[y >= 7]
